# PRISM
A possum-themed web app for learning about LGBTQIA+ identities and practicing pronouns!

## What it does
Our website serves as a comprehensive hub for all things LGBTQIA+. We offer a range of features designed to educate, empower, and keep users informed.
* Pronoun Practice: Through our app, users can practice using pronouns in various stories and scenarios. We go beyond the basics and include neopronouns like xe and fae, allowing users to become comfortable with a wide range of pronoun options.
* LGBTQIA+ Flashcards: We provide an interactive and engaging way for users to familiarize themselves with LGBTQIA+ flags and their meanings. Our flashcards offer an opportunity to learn and appreciate the diverse identities within the community.
* AI Chatbot: Meet Possum, our friendly AI chatbot! Possum is here to answer your questions and provide educational insights on LGBTQIA+ topics. Whether you're curious about terminology, history, or anything else, Possum is your go-to resource.
* Latest LGBTQIA+ News: We've integrated the most recent LGBTQIA+ news articles into our app, ensuring users stay up to date on important topics. From groundbreaking milestones to ongoing challenges, our curated news section keeps you informed and connected to the broader LGBTQIA+ community.
By combining these features, we aim to create an inclusive and educational platform that supports individuals in their journey to better understand, appreciate, and advocate for our  community.

## How we built it
First, we designed how we wanted our page to look on Figma. We then used HTML and CSS for our web pages, bootstrap for centering assets to the screen, and javascript for dealing with backend logic on our pronouns page.

## Challenges we ran into
* Styling Issues: We all had different ways of styling our web pages, so we had to make sure our pages were consistent.
* Buttons: Especially with the header, we needed to create consistent and clickable buttons that take us to new webpages.
*Backend: This was our first time working with javascript, so we needed to learn the language to make sure our pronouns practice page worked well.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
*  We made everything from scratch! This is our first time making a HTML/CSS website from bottom up
* Despite obstacles such as jobs and large courseload, we managed to make good progress
* We made a pretty and interactive user interface, keeping the user experience in mind!
